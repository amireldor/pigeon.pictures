===============

Pictures of pigeons from the interwebs that change every 30 minutes (unless I chose something different someday).

I use [zappa][1] for deployment, so you need something like `zappa deploy` or `zappa update` (for updating after deployment). Scheduling is done with deployment.

This is Python 3 stuff, so do the `pip install -r requirements.txt` magic.
